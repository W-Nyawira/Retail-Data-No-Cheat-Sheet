#Online Retail Analytics_ End-to-end project

This project analyses messy online data and transforms it into business insights that include geographic trends, revenue trends, customer behaviour, 
and sales performance. 

# Workflow

-Data cleaning and transformation using Python.
-Feature engineering for business metrics. 
-Interactive dashboard development in Excel 

Dataset: Online Retail Data (Kaggle)
Records: 500,000+ transactions

#Business Objectives
-To identify key revenue patterns that will contribute to the following business insights:
Seasonal planning
Customer analysis
Revenue trends

#Tools and Technologies
Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn, Matplotlib)
Jupyter Notebooks
Excel( Pivot Tables, charts, slicers)
Github

#Data Cleaning and Preparation(Python)

#Data Quality Issues Identified
The exploratory analysis revealed the following issues:
-Missing customer identities. 
-Negative quantities associated with cancellations. 
-Zero or negative unit prices. 
-Inconsistent data types and text formatting issues. 

#Cleaning Approach
Cleaning decisions were based on the observed data patterns and retail logic. 
Key steps included:
-Excluding recordings that had missing customer identifiers. 
-Identifying and removing cancellation transactions. 
-Filtering invalid quantities and prices. 
-Normalizing data and text fields. 
-Creating derived fields to support downstream analysis.

All the assumptions were validated using thorough exploratory checks and documentation.
